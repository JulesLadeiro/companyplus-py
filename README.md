## Database information

### By default

The database is sqlite. It's recommended to use the default database with testable datas, but you can use another database or delete the default one if you want.

It is located in the `app/db` folder, and its default name is `companyplus.db`.

### Tables

Here are the tables of the database:

- Users
- Companies
- Plannings
- Events

Below sections are the tables with their columns and some example content that are in the default database (companyplus.db).

Know that fields with a ? at the end are optional. And fields with a ! at the end are auto-generated.
